# Todos

- v0.2: [in progress] Independent Router node on Windows and macOS, trusted peer discovery, peer execution, owner-side bindings, and a Mac-offline failover integration test.
- v0.2 next: optional stable client ingress, automated node discovery/reachability, and peer-token rotation/revocation before Internet-facing use.

- Add CI regression coverage that builds the Windows public bundle and asserts no private Router address is embedded.
- Add a reproducible end-to-end remote `open_workspace` integration test with a follow-up workspace-bound operation.
- Add release automation that generates checksums and validates bundle contents before publishing.
- Add Agent revocation/token-rotation commands before recommending Internet-facing deployments.
- Add a version/protocol handshake so the Router can identify incompatible or outdated Agents.
- Add backend health to Agent heartbeats and expose distinct states such as online/backend-ready/backend-degraded.
- Add an Agent-side DevSpace supervisor/restart path so a remote machine can recover from a dead local execution backend without requiring an interactive login or reboot.
- [x] Device Registry v1 backend: persist metadata and installation UUIDs, authenticated list/rename API, deterministic peer synchronization, same-ID collision protection, and offline/non-routable device status.
- [ ] Device Registry v1 client: local-first Tailscale-style device list with live status, device detail, and authenticated rename on Mac/Windows/Android (iOS subsequently).
- [ ] Device onboarding: create immutable per-device enrollment identifiers for legacy hostname-based Agent IDs, including RedMagic registration. Never silently migrate existing router/device identities or workspace bindings.
- [ ] Test device directory on two physical PCs with bidirectional trusted peer connectivity. Peer synchronization is presently covered by local multi-Router integration tests.
- [x] Build CodasSol Mobile Android V0 as a lightweight native Kotlin control client under `mobile/android/`.
- [x] Verify the RedMagic physical-device path end to end: ADB authorization, debug APK build/install/launch, USB reverse tunnel, healthy Router response, failure state, and recovery.
