# Todos

- Add CI regression coverage that builds the Windows public bundle and asserts no private Router address is embedded.
- Add a reproducible end-to-end remote `open_workspace` integration test with a follow-up workspace-bound operation.
- Add release automation that generates checksums and validates bundle contents before publishing.
- Add Agent revocation/token-rotation commands before recommending Internet-facing deployments.
- Add a version/protocol handshake so the Router can identify incompatible or outdated Agents.
- Add backend health to Agent heartbeats and expose distinct states such as online/backend-ready/backend-degraded.
- Add an Agent-side DevSpace supervisor/restart path so a remote machine can recover from a dead local execution backend without requiring an interactive login or reboot.
